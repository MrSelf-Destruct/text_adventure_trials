{"description":"You are in what appears to have been a library of some kind. Shelves of musty and molded books line the walls. An empty fireplace dominates the Southern wall, and a table in the center of the room is covered in more modern stacks of papers and tomes. The corpse of the explorer lies crumpled and broken on the floor beside the table. There is a wooden door to the West. The library continues through a passage to the North.", "neighbors": {"w":"D41", "n":"C51"}}
