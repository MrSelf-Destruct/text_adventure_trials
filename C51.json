{"description":"You are in a small room that appears to have been a branch of a library of some kind. Old, wooden shelves once contained scrolls, all of which have long since succumbed to age and exposure. On the floor is a large, threadbare and rotted rug. There is a wooden door to the North. The library continues through a passage to the South.", "neighbors": {"s":"D51", "n":"B51"}}
