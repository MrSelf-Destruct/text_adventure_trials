Below it on the floor lies the skeleton of what appears to have been a human, dressed in clothes that have rotted away over time. There are doors to the North and South.", "hidden":"Beneath the skeleton you find an old, leather pouch and an iron dagger. The dagger is brittle with rust, and useless as a weapon. The pouch contains 5 gold pieces.", "neighbors": {"s":"C21", "n":"A21"}}
